CDCS259 FINAL YEAR PROJECT

HeartCare: Heart Disease Prediction System using Machine Learning Algorithms

Heart disease is a leading cause of the mortality worldwide and, early detection and effective management are critical for improving patient outcomes. Despite the advancements in medical technology, there is need for innovative tools to assist in continuous monitoring and prediction of heart disease. This research aims to develop a machine learning-based prediction model which can help detect and assess the risk of heart disease in individuals. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset of patient information, including demographic data, medical history, lifestyle factors, and clinical measurements, the model will provide healthcare professionals with a tool for early identification of at-risk individuals.
