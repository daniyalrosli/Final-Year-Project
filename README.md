CDCS259 FINAL YEAR PROJECT

HeartCare: Predictive Analytics for Early Detection and Prevention

Heart disease is a leading cause of mortality worldwide and, early detection and effective management are critical for improving patient outcomes. Despite the advancements in medical technology, there is a need for innovative tools to assist in continuous monitoring and prediction of heart disease. This research aims to develop a machine learning-based prediction model that can help detect and assess the risk of heart disease in individuals. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset of patient information, including demographic data, medical history, lifestyle factors, and clinical measurements, the model will provide healthcare professionals with a tool for early identification of at-risk individuals.

ML Algorithms :

- Decision Tree 
- Random Forest
- Logistic Regression

Three machine-learning algorithms will be compared to determine which algorithm has the best accuracy. The one with the best accuracy will be used to create a predictive model for heart disease prediction.
The predictive model will then be integrated into the dashboards to visualize the results, monitor patient health metrics, and provide actionable insights for healthcare professionals. This integration will allow doctors to interact with patient data, identify high-risk individuals, and make data-driven decisions, improving the overall effectiveness of heart disease management.

Tech Stack Used :

1. Frontend - Next.js
2. Backend - Django & Flask
3. Model Development - Jupyter Notebook
4. Databases - MySQL
