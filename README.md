CDCS259 FINAL YEAR PROJECT

HeartCare: Heart Disease Prediction System using Machine Learning Algorithms

Heart disease is a leading cause of mortality worldwide and, early detection and effective management are critical for improving patient outcomes. Despite the advancements in medical technology, there is a need for innovative tools to assist in continuous monitoring and prediction of heart disease. This research aims to develop a machine learning-based prediction model that can help detect and assess the risk of heart disease in individuals. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset of patient information, including demographic data, medical history, lifestyle factors, and clinical measurements, the model will provide healthcare professionals with a tool for early identification of at-risk individuals.


ML Algorithms :

- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Logistic Regression

Three machine-learning algorithms will be compared to determine which algorithm has the best accuracy. The one with the best accuracy will be used to create a predictive model for heart disease prediction.
